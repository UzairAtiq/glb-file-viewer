# 3D Nexus

A personal hobby project for viewing and interacting with 3D models in the browser. This is a private experimental playground for testing 3D visualization techniques.

## Features

- **Interactive 3D Viewer** - Drag to rotate, scroll to zoom, shift+drag to pan
- **Model Gallery** - Quick thumbnail navigation between different 3D models
- **AI-Generated Quotes** - Random anime-style quotes with a refresh button
- **Dark Modern UI** - Premium glassmorphic design with gradient accents
- **Responsive Layout** - Works on desktop and mobile devices

## Tech Stack

- **Three.js** - 3D rendering engine
- **GLTFLoader** - For loading .glb 3D model files
- **Vanilla JavaScript** - No framework dependencies
- **CSS3** - Modern animations and glassmorphism effects
- **HTML5** - Semantic structure

## Getting Started

Simply open `index.html` in a modern browser. No build process or dependencies required.

```bash
open index.html
```

## Project Structure

```
3d_mmodel/
├── index.html          # Main application file (single-file architecture)
├── models/            # 3D model files (.glb format)
└── README.md          # This file
```

## Usage

1. Select a model from the dropdown or click a thumbnail
2. Interact with the 3D view using mouse/touch
3. Toggle "Follow Mouse" for dynamic camera movement
4. Refresh quotes for new AI-generated content
